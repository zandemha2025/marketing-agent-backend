# Blog Post Format Expertise

## Platform Purpose

Blog posts are long-form content that establishes expertise, drives organic search traffic, and provides substantial value that can't fit in social formats. A blog post should be the definitive resource on its topic.

## Blog Post Hierarchy

```
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │     TITLE       │ ← Promise of value
        └────────┬────────┘
                 ↓
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │    HOOK/INTRO   │ ← Why should I read this?
        └────────┬────────┘
                 ↓
        ┌─────────────────┐

## Introduction Framework

The intro must accomplish three things:
1. **Hook**: Why should I care right now?
2. **Promise**: What will I get from reading?
3. **Credibility**: Why should I trust you?

### Intro Patterns

**The Problem Agitation**:
"If you've ever [problem], you know how frustrating it can be. You've probably tried [common solutions], only to end up [still with problem]. In this post, I'll show you [what they'll learn]."

**The Story Opening**:
"Last year, I [did something] and it changed everything. Here's what happened and what you can learn from it."

**The Data Hook**:
"[Statistic that surprises or alarms]. That's why I put together this guide to [topic]."

**The Direct Promise**:
"By the end of this post, you'll know exactly how to [outcome]. Let's dive in."

## Body Structure

### The Subheading Rule
- Use H2 for main sections
- Use H3 for subsections
- Every 200-300 words needs a new heading
- Headings should be scannable (reader gets value from headings alone)

### Section Structure
Each section should have:
1. **Transition** from previous section
2. **Main point** clearly stated
3. **Explanation** or evidence
4. **Example** or illustration
5. **Action step** (what to do with this info)

### Formatting for Readability
- Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences max
- Sentences: Under 25 words
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Bold key phrases (not whole sentences)
- One idea per paragraph
