# Landing Page Format Expertise

## Core Philosophy

A landing page has one job: convert visitors into leads or customers. Every element either supports that goal or detracts from it. There is no neutral space on a landing page.

## The Conversion Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                ABOVE THE FOLD                    │
│  "What is this? Is it for me? What do I do?"    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                  PROBLEM                         │
│  "They understand what I'm going through"        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                  SOLUTION                        │
│  "Here's how they solve my problem"              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                  PROOF                           │
│  "Others like me have succeeded with this"       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                  OBJECTIONS                      │
│  "They've addressed my concerns"                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                   ACTION                         │
│  "I know exactly what to do next"                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Above the Fold Requirements

Visitors decide in 5 seconds. Above the fold must answer:
1. **What** is this? (Product/service/offer)
2. **Who** is it for? (Target audience signal)
3. **Why** should I care? (Primary benefit)
4. **What** do I do? (CTA)

### Hero Section Formula
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Logo]                    [Single nav item max] │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│   HEADLINE (Benefit in under 10 words)          │
│   Subheadline (How you deliver that benefit)    │
│                                                 │
│   [Primary CTA]    [Secondary CTA - optional]   │
│                                                 │
│   [Trust indicator: logos/stats/social proof]   │
│                                                 │
│            [Hero image/video]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Headline Formulas

### The Direct Benefit
"[Get/Achieve] [Desired Outcome]"
Example: "Get More Qualified Leads"

### The "Without" Formula
"[Achieve Outcome] Without [Pain Point]"
Example: "Grow Your Business Without Burning Out"

### The Comparison
"The [Better Alternative] for [Audience]"
Example: "The Mailchimp Alternative for Growing Businesses"

### The Specific Outcome
"[Specific Number/Outcome] in [Timeframe]"
Example: "10,000 Email Subscribers in 90 Days"

### The Question
"[Question That Identifies Pain]?"
Example: "Tired of Wasting Money on Ads That Don't Convert?"

## Section Templates

### Problem Section
```
Headline: Name the pain they're experiencing
Body:
- Describe their current reality (with empathy)
- List 3 specific frustrations
- Make them feel understood, not attacked
Visual: Image showing the "before" state
```

### Solution Section
```
Headline: Introduce your approach (not your product)
Body:
- Explain HOW it works (mechanism)
- 3 key differentiators
- Why this approach is different
Visual: Product in context or diagram
```

### Features → Benefits Section
```
Format: 3-6 features, each with:
- Icon or visual
- Feature name (bold)
- Benefit explanation (why they care)
- Keep each to 2-3 sentences

DON'T: List features
DO: Translate features into outcomes
```

### Social Proof Section
```
Types to include:
- Testimonials (specific results > vague praise)
- Company logos
- Numbers (users, revenue generated, etc.)
- Case study snippets
- Reviews/ratings
- Media mentions

Placement: After you've made your case, before asking for action
```

### FAQ Section
```
Purpose: Handle objections disguised as questions
Include:
- Real objections (not softballs)
- Pricing/value questions
- "How is this different" questions
- Risk/commitment questions
Format: Accordion for space efficiency
```

### Final CTA Section
```
Headline: Restate the primary benefit
Subheadline: Risk reversal or urgency
CTA Button: Same as hero
Supporting: Guarantee, trial details, or testimonial
```

## CTA Best Practices

### Button Copy
DO:
- First person: "Start My Free Trial"
- Specific outcome: "Get My Custom Report"
- Low friction first: "See How It Works"

DON'T:
- Generic: "Submit", "Click Here"
- High commitment early: "Buy Now" (for cold traffic)
- Vague: "Learn More"

### CTA Placement
- Above the fold (always)
- After social proof section
- After FAQ/objection handling
- Bottom of page
- Sticky header (for long pages)

### CTA Design
- Contrasting color (doesn't need to match brand)
- Large enough to tap on mobile
- Clear visual hierarchy (primary vs. secondary)
- White space around the button

## Form Optimization

### Field Rules
- Only ask what you NEED
- Email-only for top of funnel
- Put easiest fields first
- Use smart defaults
- Show progress for multi-step

### Form Placement
- Short forms: Embedded in hero
- Longer forms: Separate section or modal
- Multi-step: Progressive revelation

### Friction Reducers
- "No spam, unsubscribe anytime"
- "Free forever" or "No credit card required"
- Privacy statement link
- Social proof near submit button

## Page Types & Length

### Lead Magnet Page
- Length: Short (1-2 screens)
- Elements: Headline, bullets, form
- CTA: "Get the [Resource]"

### Product Landing Page
- Length: Medium to long
- Elements: Full persuasion sequence
- CTA: "Start Free Trial" or "Get Started"

### Sales Page
- Length: Long (scrolling)
- Elements: Deep persuasion, multiple proof sections

### Webinar/Event Page
- Length: Medium

## Copy Guidelines

## Common Landing Page Mistakes

- **Multiple CTAs**: Competing actions confuse visitors
- **Feature-focused**: Benefits > features always
- **No social proof**: Claims without evidence
- **Wall of text**: Dense copy kills conversion
- **Slow load time**: Every second costs conversions
- **Generic copy**: Could work for any competitor
- **Buried CTA**: Make it obvious and accessible
- **No risk reversal**: Address the fear of commitment
- **Mobile afterthought**: Test on phone first
