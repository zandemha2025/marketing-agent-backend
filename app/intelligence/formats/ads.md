# Advertising Copy Format Expertise

## Core Philosophy

An ad is an interruption. Your job is to earn the attention you're stealing. Every word must pull its weight or get cut.

## Ad Copy Hierarchy

```
ATTENTION → INTEREST → DESIRE → ACTION (AIDA)

But modern digital is more like:

STOP → HOLD → CONVINCE → CONVERT
(the scroll) → (for 3 sec) → (to care) → (to act)
```

## Copywriting Formulas

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
```
PROBLEM: [State the pain point]
AGITATE: [Make them feel it more]
SOLUTION: [Your product/service]
```
Example: "Spending hours on reports? Imagine what you'd do with that time back. [Product] generates reports in minutes."

### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)
```
BEFORE: [Current state]
AFTER: [Desired state]
BRIDGE: [How you get them there]
```
Example: "Before: 4-hour commute. After: Working in your pajamas. Bridge: Remote jobs on [Platform]."

### The 4 Cs
1. **Clear**: No confusion about what you offer
2. **Concise**: Every word earns its place
3. **Compelling**: Reason to care now
4. **Credible**: Reason to believe you

### FOMO Formula
```
[Scarcity] + [Social Proof] + [Urgency] = Action
```
Example: "Only 3 spots left. Join 5,000+ marketers. Sale ends tonight."

## Headline Techniques

### Number Headlines
"[Number] [Things] That [Outcome]"
Example: "7 Emails That Doubled Our Revenue"

### How Headlines
"How [Audience] [Achieve Outcome]"
Example: "How Smart Founders Raise Money in 2024"

### Question Headlines
"[Question that triggers curiosity]?"
Example: "Is Your Website Losing You Customers?"

### Challenge Headlines
"[Bold claim or challenge]"
Example: "Your CRM Is Lying to You"

### Benefit Headlines
"Get [Benefit] [Qualifier]"
Example: "Get More Leads Without More Ad Spend"

## CTA Best Practices

### Strong CTAs
- "Start Free Trial" (specific, low-friction)
- "Get My Custom Report" (personalized)
- "See How It Works" (curiosity)
- "Claim Your Discount" (ownership)
- "Join 10,000+ [Audience]" (social proof)

### Weak CTAs (Avoid)
- "Submit" (generic)
- "Click Here" (vague)
- "Learn More" (passive)
- "Buy Now" (too pushy for cold traffic)

### CTA Placement
- Primary CTA: End of copy
- Secondary CTA: Within copy for long-form
- Visual CTA: Button that stands out

## Ad Copy Testing Framework

### What to Test
1. **Headlines**: Benefit vs. curiosity vs. proof
2. **Primary text**: Long vs. short
3. **CTA**: Action words, urgency
4. **Angles**: Different value props
5. **Social proof**: With vs. without

### Testing Principles
- One variable at a time
- Statistically significant sample size
- Run for at least 3-5 days
- Document learnings

## Quality Checklist

Before launching:
- [ ] Hook stops the scroll in 1-2 seconds
- [ ] Value prop clear within 5 seconds
- [ ] Single, focused message
- [ ] CTA is specific and compelling
- [ ] Matches landing page message
- [ ] Within platform character limits
- [ ] A/B variations created
- [ ] Targeting aligned with copy

## Common Ad Mistakes

- **Feature focus**: Benefits sell, features tell
- **Generic claims**: "Best in class" means nothing
- **No urgency**: Why act now vs. later?
- **Mismatched landing page**: Ad promise ≠ page reality
- **One ad fits all**: Different audiences need different messages
- **Testing too many things**: Can't learn what worked
- **Ignoring mobile**: Most impressions are mobile
- **Forgetting the audience**: What THEY want, not what you want to say
