# Email Format Expertise

## The Email Psychology Stack

Email success is a cascade of micro-decisions:
1. **Inbox Competition**: Stand out among 100+ daily emails
2. **Subject Line**: Earn the open
3. **Preview Text**: Confirm the promise
4. **Above the Fold**: Hook them before scroll
5. **Body**: Deliver value or desire
6. **CTA**: Make action frictionless

## Subject Line Mastery

### Character Limits
- Mobile shows: 30-40 characters
- Desktop shows: 60-70 characters
- Front-load the value in first 30 characters

### Subject Line Formulas

**Curiosity Gap:**
- "The one thing we never told you about [X]"
- "This changes everything about [X]"
- "We need to talk about [X]"

**Benefit-Driven:**
- "[Outcome] in [timeframe]"
- "The fastest way to [benefit]"
- "How [customer type] [achieved result]"

**Urgency/Scarcity:**
- "24 hours left: [offer]"
- "Your [thing] is waiting"
- "Last chance for [benefit]"

**Personal/Direct:**
- "Quick question, [Name]"
- "You're invited"
- "A gift for you"

### Subject Line A/B Test Variables
- With vs without personalization
- Question vs statement
- Emoji vs no emoji
- Length (short vs medium)
- Curiosity vs benefit

## Preview Text Strategy

Preview text complements (never repeats) the subject line.

### Patterns
- Subject: Question → Preview: Answer tease
- Subject: Statement → Preview: "Here's why..."
- Subject: Curiosity → Preview: Specificity
- Subject: Offer → Preview: Urgency/social proof

### Length
- Optimal: 40-90 characters
- Too short = email client pulls body text
- Too long = gets cut off

## Email Structure

### Above the Fold
The first 300 pixels must:
- Confirm the subject line promise
- Create reason to keep reading
- Be scannable on mobile

### Body Organization

**The Inverted Pyramid:**
```
Most important info (hook)
        ↓
Supporting details
        ↓
Background/context
        ↓
     CTA
```

**The Story Arc:**
```
Tension/Problem
     ↓
Agitation
     ↓
Solution
     ↓
   CTA
```

### Content Blocks
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- One idea per paragraph
- Strategic white space
- Mobile-optimized line lengths

## CTA Optimization

### Button Best Practices
- Action verbs: "Get," "Start," "Claim," "Join"
- Specific: "Get My Free Guide" > "Download"
- Single primary CTA (can repeat)
- Above the fold AND end of email
- Minimum 44×44px tap target

### CTA Placement
- First CTA: After value hook (25% into email)
- Second CTA: End of email
- Link in PS line (most-read section)

## Email Types & Approaches

### Welcome Sequence
1. Welcome + brand story + expectations
2. Best content/resource
3. Social proof/community
4. Product introduction (soft)
5. CTA/offer

### Promotional
- Lead with benefit, not features
- Create urgency (real, not fake)
- Address objections
- Social proof
- Clear CTA

### Newsletter
- Consistent format readers expect
- Value first, promotion second
- Scannable sections
- One main topic or 3-5 short items

### Abandoned Cart
- Timing: 1hr, 24hr, 72hr
- Show the items
- Address concerns
- Incentive in email 2 or 3

## Technical Considerations

### Mobile Optimization
- 60%+ open on mobile
- Single column layout
- Large text (minimum 14px body)
- Large buttons (minimum 44px)
- Adequate padding

### Accessibility
- Alt text for all images
