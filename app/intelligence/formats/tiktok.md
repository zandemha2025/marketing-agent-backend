# TikTok Format Expertise

## Platform Culture

TikTok is not a place to advertise AT people. It's a place to create WITH the culture. Content must feel native to the platform or it gets scrolled past immediately.

## The 3-Second Rule

You have 3 seconds to stop the scroll. The hook must:
- Create curiosity or tension
- Use movement or visual intrigue
- Start mid-action, not with logos
- Feel like content, not an ad

## Video Specifications

| Spec | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Aspect Ratio | 9:16 (vertical) |
| Resolution | 1080×1920 |
| Length | 15-60 seconds optimal (up to 10 min allowed) |
| File Size | Max 287.6 MB |
| Format | MP4 or MOV |

## Content Formats That Work

### Trending Formats
- POV scenarios
- Day in the life
- Before/After transformations
- Storytime with text overlays
- Duets and stitches
- Sound-driven content
- Tutorial/How-to

### Brand-Safe Formats
- Behind the scenes
- Product in real use
- Customer stories
- Expert tips
- Myth busting
- Trend participation

## Caption Best Practices

- 150 characters for full visibility without "more"
- Front-load the hook
- Use line breaks strategically
- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Mix trending + niche hashtags
- Include CTA when appropriate

## Sound Strategy

Sound is 50% of TikTok success:
- Trending sounds boost discovery
- Original sounds build brand identity
- Voiceover feels more authentic than text-to-speech
- Music must match energy and mood

## Posting Strategy

### Best Times (General)
- Tuesday-Thursday: 10am, 2pm, 8pm
- Friday: 12pm, 7pm
- Weekend: 9am, 12pm

### Consistency
- 1-4 posts per day for growth
- Maintain consistent voice/style
- Build content series for return viewers

## The TikTok Hook Formula

### Opening Lines That Work
- "Nobody talks about this but..."
- "POV: [scenario]"
- "The [product] that changed my [routine]"
- "I tested [thing] for 30 days..."
- "Stop scrolling if you [identify with X]"

### Opening Visuals That Work
- Face close-up with expression
- Product in action
- Before state (implying transformation)
- Text overlay with hook
- Movement toward camera

## What NOT to Do

- Don't start with logo
- Don't use horizontal video
- Don't ignore trending sounds
- Don't over-produce (authenticity wins)
- Don't hard-sell in first 3 seconds
- Don't use corporate voice
- Don't ignore comments
- Don't post without captions (accessibility + muted viewing)
