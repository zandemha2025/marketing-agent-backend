# Twitter/X Format Expertise

## Platform Culture

Twitter is where conversations happen in real-time. It rewards wit, brevity, and strong opinions. Brands that win here have personality and aren't afraid to engage.

## The Twitter Attention Economy

- Feeds move FAST
- You're competing with news, friends, and memes
- Every tweet is a standalone unit
- Personality > perfection
- Hot takes get reach; thoughtful takes get followers

## Tweet Types

### Single Tweets
- Punchy, complete thought
- Under 280 characters (even though you have more)
- Hook is everything
- Standalone value

### Threads
- Educational or storytelling format
- 5-12 tweets optimal
- First tweet = the hook that promises value
- Number your tweets (1/, 2/, etc.) for clarity
- Last tweet = CTA + summary

### Quote Tweets
- Add unique perspective, not just "This!"
- Great for hot takes on industry news
- Build on the original, don't just agree
- Respectful disagreement performs well

### Replies
- Conversation drives the platform
- Thoughtful replies build followers
- Don't just pitch; add value
- Getting ratio'd (more replies than likes) is bad

## Tweet Specifications

| Element | Limit/Spec |
|---------|-----------|
| Character limit | 280 (Basic) / 25,000 (Premium) |
| Images | Up to 4 per tweet |
| Image size | 1200x675 (landscape) or 1200x1200 (square) |
| Video | Up to 2:20 (Basic) / longer for Premium |
| GIFs | One per tweet |
| Links | Count toward character limit |

## Tweet Structure

### The Hook Formulas

**The Contrarian**:
"Hot take: [opinion that challenges norm]"

**The Promise**:
"I spent [time] learning [thing]. Here's what I found:"

**The Story**:
"In 2019, I [did something]. It was a mistake. Here's why:"

**The List**:
"[Number] things I wish I knew about [topic]:"

**The Question**:
"Why does everyone [do X] when [Y] is clearly better?"

**The Observation**:
"Nobody talks about [thing], but [insight about it]"

### Body Principles
- One idea per tweet
- Short sentences punch harder
- Remove words until it breaks, then add one back
- Line breaks create pacing
- Avoid hashtags in body (looks spammy)

### Thread Structure
```
Tweet 1: The hook (why should I read this?)
Tweet 2: Context or "Here's the story"
Tweets 3-8: The value (one point per tweet)
Tweet 9: Summary or key takeaway
Tweet 10: CTA + "Follow for more"
```

## Voice & Tone

### What Works on Twitter
- Confident opinions
- Self-deprecating humor
- Behind-the-scenes honesty
- Real-time reactions
- Admitting when you're wrong
- Celebrating others publicly

### What Doesn't Work
- Corporate speak
- Hashtag every word
- Promotional spam
- "Please RT" begging
- Thread of threads
- Scheduling without monitoring

## Engagement Strategy

### Timing
- Morning: 7-9am EST (early risers, global audience)
- Lunch: 12-1pm EST
- Evening: 5-7pm EST
- Breaking news moments: any time
- Weekends: lower volume, sometimes better engagement

### Reply Strategy
- Reply within first hour when possible
- Turn good replies into conversations
- QT interesting replies to amplify
- Don't argue with trolls

### Building Followers
- Thread at least 2x per week
- Engage with larger accounts genuinely
- Quote tweet with strong takes
- Be consistent in voice and topic

## Hashtag Strategy

Twitter hashtags are different:
- 1-2 maximum (more looks desperate)
- Only use if genuinely trending AND relevant
- Don't create branded hashtags (they don't work here)
- Better to not use any than to force it

## Content Patterns

### The Ratio Breaker
Write tweets that get more likes/RTs than replies:
- Helpful content > controversial content
- Specific > general
- Actionable > abstract

### The Engagement Generator
Posts that spark conversation:
- "What's your take on [thing]?"
- "Unpopular opinion thread 👇"
- "The best advice I ever got was..."
- "Finish this sentence: [prompt]"

### The Thread Formats
- Lessons learned (numbered list)
- Story thread (narrative arc)
- Resource thread (curated links/tools)
- Breakdown thread (analyzing something)
- Prediction thread (what's coming)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Good | Great | Going Viral |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| Impressions | 10x followers | 50x followers | 100x+ followers |
| Engagement Rate | 2% | 5% | 10%+ |
| Replies | 5+ | 20+ | 100+ |
| Retweets | 10+ | 100+ | 500+ |
| Thread engagement | 30%+ read past tweet 1 | 50%+ | 70%+ |

## Twitter-Specific CTAs

- "RT if you agree"
- "Drop a 🔥 in the replies"
- "What would you add?"
- "Follow for more [topic] threads"
- "Save this thread (click bookmark)"
- "Like + RT = I'll DM you the [thing]"
- "Quote tweet your take"

## Common Twitter Mistakes

- **Thread everything**: Not every thought needs 12 tweets
- **Hashtag stuffing**: #This #Looks #Like #Spam
- **Schedule and forget**: Twitter rewards real-time presence
- **Only promoting**: Give value before you ask
- **Ignoring mentions**: Relationship building opportunity
- **Viral chasing**: Consistency > one-hit-wonders
- **Same voice as LinkedIn**: Twitter is more casual
- **Deleting tweets**: Own your takes or don't post them

## Advanced Tactics

### Engagement Pods
- Find your niche community
- Support each other's content genuinely
- Don't make it obvious (coordinate in DMs)

### Timing Hacks
- Post thread at low-competition times
- Schedule first tweet, post rest manually
- Reply to your own thread to boost it

### The Screenshot Format
- Screenshot compelling text (LinkedIn post, article excerpt)
- Add a one-line hot take
- Drives high engagement
