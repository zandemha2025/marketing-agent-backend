# Research Quality Rubric

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Insight Depth (vs. Surface Observation)
**5 - Exceptional**: Reveals an unexpected tension or truth that changes how we think about the problem. Makes people say "I never thought about it that way."
**4 - Strong**: Identifies a meaningful tension between what people say and do. Actionable for strategy.
**3 - Adequate**: Good observation but doesn't quite reach insight territory. True but not surprising.
**2 - Weak**: Surface-level data collection. Facts without interpretation.
**1 - Poor**: Generic information that could apply to any category. No original analysis.

### 2. Source Quality
**5 - Exceptional**: Multiple high-quality sources triangulated. Primary research or authoritative data. Recency appropriate to topic.
**4 - Strong**: Good mix of credible sources. Recent data where needed. Clear attribution.
**3 - Adequate**: Reliable sources but limited variety. Some dates may be outdated.
**2 - Weak**: Single source reliance. Questionable credibility. Missing key perspectives.
**1 - Poor**: Unsourced claims. Outdated data presented as current. Misinformation risk.

### 3. Relevance to Brief
**5 - Exceptional**: Every finding directly connects to a strategic question. Research suggests clear creative direction.
**4 - Strong**: Most findings are actionable. Clear connection to campaign objectives.
**3 - Adequate**: Generally relevant but includes tangential information. Needs curation.
**2 - Weak**: Data dump without clear connection to the task. Interesting but not useful.
**1 - Poor**: Research is off-topic or doesn't address the actual question asked.

### 4. Competitive Intelligence
**5 - Exceptional**: Identifies specific competitive gaps and opportunities. Shows what competitors can't or won't say.
**4 - Strong**: Clear competitive positioning. Identifies differentiation opportunities.
**3 - Adequate**: Lists competitors and their positioning but doesn't find white space.
**2 - Weak**: Surface-level competitor list. Feature comparison without strategic insight.
**1 - Poor**: No competitive context. Operates as if brand exists in a vacuum.

### 5. Cultural Context
**5 - Exceptional**: Identifies relevant cultural moments, tensions, or trends that the brand can authentically participate in.
**4 - Strong**: Good understanding of cultural landscape. Timing considerations included.
**3 - Adequate**: Notes cultural trends but doesn't connect them to brand opportunity.
**2 - Weak**: Generic trend lists without specificity or relevance.
**1 - Poor**: Ignores cultural context entirely. Research exists in a vacuum.

## Scoring Guide

| Total Score | Rating | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| 23-25 | Exceptional | Ready for strategy. Breakthrough potential. |
| 19-22 | Strong | Good foundation. Minor refinements needed. |
| 14-18 | Adequate | Needs deeper analysis before strategy. |
| 10-13 | Weak | Requires substantial rework. |
| 5-9 | Poor | Start over with clearer objectives. |

## Quick Self-Check

Before submitting research, ask:

1. **Did I find an insight or just collect data?**
   - Data: "Millennials use mobile phones"
   - Insight: "Millennials trust peer recommendations over brand claims because they grew up during the financial crisis"

2. **Could a strategist build a brief from this?**
   - If not, what's missing?
   - What strategic questions remain unanswered?

3. **Is there competitive white space identified?**
   - What can this brand say that competitors can't?
   - Where are competitors vulnerable?

4. **Is the timing right?**
   - Is this culturally relevant right now?
   - Are there upcoming moments to leverage?

5. **Did I challenge assumptions?**
   - Did I question the brief's starting hypotheses?
   - Did I look for disconfirming evidence?

## Red Flags
