## Quick Self-Check Questions

Before considering copy complete, answer honestly:

1. **The Competitor Test**: Could I swap in a competitor's name and it still works? If yes → revise for specificity.

2. **The So-What Test**: Would the audience say "so what?" to any sentence? If yes → add stakes or relevance.

3. **The Scroll Test**: Would someone stop scrolling for this? If no → strengthen hook.

4. **The Share Test**: Would someone screenshot or share this? If no → add quotability.

5. **The Action Test**: Is it absolutely clear what the reader should do next? If no → strengthen CTA.

## Common Deductions

**-1 point each:**
- Uses "very," "really," or "actually"
- Opens with "In today's [X]..."
- Uses passive voice when active is better
- Includes jargon the audience won't know
- CTA says "Click Here" or "Learn More"
- Copy could work for any brand in category
- No clear emotional journey
- Longer than necessary
