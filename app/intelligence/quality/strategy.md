## Quick Self-Check Questions

### For Concepts:
1. **The Surprise Test**: Does this make anyone say "that's clever"? If no → dig deeper.
2. **The Truth Test**: Is this genuinely true about human behavior? If unsure → validate.
3. **The Ownership Test**: Could only this brand do this? If no → differentiate.
4. **The Legs Test**: Can this run for 12+ months? If no → expand thinking.

### For Briefs:
1. **The Clarity Test**: Could a junior creative execute this perfectly? If no → add specificity.
2. **The Single Test**: Is the single-minded message truly single? If there's "and" → cut.
3. **The Guard Rails Test**: Will the DON'T DOs prevent common mistakes? If no → anticipate issues.

### For Campaign Strategy:
1. **The Why Test**: Is it clear why this approach will work? If no → strengthen rationale.
2. **The How Test**: Is the execution path clear? If no → add detail.
3. **The What-If Test**: What happens if this doesn't work? If no backup → add flexibility.

## Red Flags to Catch

- Strategy that's actually just tactics
- Insight that's actually just an observation
- Concept that's actually just a tagline
- Brief that's actually just an assignment
- Differentiation that's actually just category benefits
- "Be more [positive adjective]" as direction
