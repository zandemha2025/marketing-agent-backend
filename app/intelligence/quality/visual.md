## Quick Self-Check Questions

1. **The Brand Test**: If you removed the logo, would people still know the brand? If no → strengthen brand elements.

2. **The Scroll Test**: Would this make someone stop scrolling? If no → increase visual interest.

3. **The Squint Test**: When you squint, is the hierarchy still clear? If no → strengthen visual hierarchy.

4. **The Context Test**: Will this work where it will actually be seen? If unsure → check platform specs.

5. **The Accessibility Test**: Can all users perceive and understand this? If no → fix contrast and readability.

## Common Deductions

**-1 point each:**
- Logo has insufficient clear space
- Text smaller than platform minimum
- Contrast ratio below 4.5:1
- Important elements in unsafe zones
- Generic stock photography
- Inconsistent with other campaign pieces
- Color palette doesn't match brand
- Overdesigned/cluttered
