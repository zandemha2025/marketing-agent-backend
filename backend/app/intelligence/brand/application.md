# Brand Application Logic

This document defines how brand DNA should be applied consistently across all outputs.

## Brand DNA Components

Every brand has these foundational elements:

### 1. Brand Identity
- **Name**: The brand name and any approved variations
- **Industry**: Category context
- **Value Proposition**: The core promise

### 2. Brand Voice
- **Tone**: Overall personality (professional, playful, bold, etc.)
- **Voice Characteristics**: Specific traits that define how the brand speaks
- **Preferred Language**: Words and phrases to embrace
- **Avoided Language**: Words and phrases to never use

### 3. Visual Identity
- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, and accent palette
- **Typography**: Headline and body fonts
- **Imagery Style**: Photography approach, illustration style

### 4. Audience
- **Primary Audience**: Core customer profile
- **Pain Points**: What problems they face
- **Desires**: What they aspire to

## Voice Adaptation Matrix

| Brand Tone | Writing Style | Visual Style | Emotional Target |
|------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Professional | Confident, straightforward, knowledgeable | Clean lines, structured, intentional white space | Trust, reliability |
| Casual | Friendly, conversational, relatable | Lifestyle photos, candid moments, bright colors | Connection, comfort |
| Bold | Assertive, direct, unapologetic | High contrast, dramatic angles, saturated colors | Empowerment, confidence |
| Playful | Witty, energetic, surprising | Vibrant colors, dynamic compositions, illustrated elements | Joy, delight |
| Sophisticated | Elegant, refined, understated | Minimal elements, neutral palettes, refined typography | Aspiration, exclusivity |
| Warm | Empathetic, supportive, genuine | Soft lighting, warm tones, intimate framing | Belonging, care |
| Edgy | Provocative, unconventional, challenging | Gritty textures, unconventional crops, stark contrasts | Rebellion, authenticity |

## Application Rules

### Copy Application

**Always:**
- Use the brand's preferred language over synonyms
- Match the tone in every sentence, not just overall
- Reference value proposition without being salesy
- Speak TO the audience, not AT them

**Never:**
- Use words on the "avoid" list
- Adopt a competitor's voice
- Be generic when specificity is available
- Sacrifice clarity for cleverness

### Visual Application

**Always:**
- Lead with primary brand color
- Use approved typography hierarchy
- Match imagery style to brand tone
- Maintain consistent treatment across pieces

**Never:**
- Introduce new colors without purpose
- Mix incompatible styles
- Use generic stock that doesn't fit brand
- Ignore established visual patterns

### Concept Application

**Always:**
- Build from brand's unique position
- Connect to value proposition
- Consider audience's emotional state
- Create ownable territory

**Never:**
- Develop ideas any competitor could use
- Ignore brand heritage
- Contradict established positioning
- Chase trends that don't fit

## Consistency Across Channels

Each channel has its own culture, but brand should feel consistent:

| Channel | Adaptation Allowed | Must Remain Constant |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Social | Casual variation of tone, platform-native formats | Core voice, colors, visual style |
| Email | Direct, personal address | Tone, typography, CTA style |
| Website | Full brand expression | Everything—this is brand home |
| Ads | Bold, attention-grabbing | Colors, voice, value proposition |
| Video | Motion, music, pacing flexibility | Visual style, voice, tone |

## Brand Dilution Warning Signs

Watch for these signs that brand is being diluted:

1. **Voice Drift**: Copy sounds different across pieces
2. **Color Creep**: New colors appearing without purpose
3. **Tone Inconsistency**: Playful in social, corporate in email
4. **Generic Choices**: Stock photos that could be anyone
5. **Competitor Confusion**: Work that could be swapped

## Quality Gate: The Brand Test

Before any output is approved, ask:

1. **Recognition Test**: If you covered the logo, would someone know the brand?
2. **Voice Test**: Does every sentence sound like THIS brand would say it?
3. **Visual Test**: Does the look match established brand guidelines?
4. **Competitor Test**: Could any competitor use this exact work?
5. **Consistency Test**: Does this match other recent brand outputs?

If any answer is "no" or "unsure" → revise before delivery.

## Working with New Brands

When brand DNA is limited:

1. **Extract from what exists**: Website, social, past campaigns
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: What brands do they admire? What do they NOT want to be?
3. **Start conservative**: Default to more professional, then adapt
4. **Document decisions**: Build guidelines as you go
5. **Get feedback early**: Validate direction before full production
