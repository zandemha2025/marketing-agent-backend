Body (valuable content, broken into short paragraphs)

CTA (specific action to take)

.

.
Hashtags (or in first comment)
```

### Hook Formulas

- "[Number] [things] that will [benefit]"
- "Stop [doing X]. Do this instead:"

### Caption Length Strategy

- Medium (300-500): Storytelling, relatable moments
- Long (1000+): Educational, valuable, saveable

## Hashtag Strategy

### Hashtag Mix
- 3-5 broad hashtags (1M+ posts)
- 5-10 medium hashtags (100K-1M posts)
- 5-10 niche hashtags (10K-100K posts)
- 2-3 branded hashtags

### Placement Options
1. End of caption (clean look)
2. First comment (keeps caption tidy)
3. Hidden with line breaks
