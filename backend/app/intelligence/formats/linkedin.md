# LinkedIn Format Expertise

## Platform Culture

LinkedIn is the professional networking platform where people come to advance their careers, learn industry insights, and build professional relationships. Content that wins here combines expertise with authenticity.

## The LinkedIn Algorithm

What drives reach:
1. **Dwell Time**: How long people spend on your post
2. **Early Engagement**: Comments and reactions in first hour
3. **Conversation**: Posts that spark discussion
4. **Network Effect**: When your connections engage, their network sees it

## Post Types That Perform

### Text Posts
- Most authentic format
- 1,200-1,500 characters optimal
- Use line breaks liberally
- Hook in first 2 lines (before "see more")
- End with engagement prompt

### Carousels (Document Posts)
- Educational content goldmine
- 8-12 slides optimal
- First slide = hook (not title)
- One idea per slide
- CTA on final slide

### Articles
- Longer thought leadership
- SEO benefits (searchable)
- 1,000-2,000 words
- Use for evergreen content
- Share as post with teaser

### Video
- Native video preferred over links
- Square or vertical format
- Captions essential (sound-off viewing)
- Under 3 minutes optimal
- Hook in first 3 seconds

### Polls
- High engagement format
- 4 options maximum
- Use for market research or conversation starters
- Follow up with results analysis

## Post Structure

### The LinkedIn Hook Formula

The first two lines must earn the "see more" click:

**Pattern Interrupt**:
"Everyone thinks [common belief].

They're wrong."

**Story Tease**:
"Last month I made a decision that terrified me.

Here's what happened..."

**Contrarian Take**:
"Unpopular opinion: [challenge to accepted wisdom]"

**Data Hook**:
"I analyzed 500 [things] and found something surprising."

**Direct Address**:
"If you're a [role] struggling with [problem], read this."

### Body Structure

```
[Hook - 2 lines that demand attention]

[Line break]

[Story/Context - what happened, what you observed]

[Line break]

[Insight - what you learned or realized]

[Line break]

[Framework or takeaway - actionable for reader]

[Line break]

[Soft CTA - question or prompt for engagement]

[Hashtags - 3-5, separated]
```

### The "So What" Test
Every paragraph must pass the "So what?" test:
- "I worked 80 hours this week" → So what?
- "I worked 80 hours this week and realized I was running from something" → Interesting, tell me more

## Content Pillars for LinkedIn

## LinkedIn Voice

### What Works
- First-person narrative
- Specific, concrete examples
- Admitting mistakes
- Data + story combination
- Taking a clear stance

### What Doesn't Work
- Corporate jargon
- Vague motivational content
- Humble bragging
- Engagement bait ("Like if you agree!")
- Copying trending formats exactly

## Engagement Strategy

### Posting Schedule
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Best times: 7-8am, 12pm, 5-6pm (local time)
- Frequency: 3-5 posts per week
- Stay active in comments for 1 hour after posting

### Comment Strategy
- First comment should add value, not just "Great post!"
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share relevant experience
- Tag relevant people thoughtfully

### DM Strategy
- Don't pitch immediately
- Lead with value
- Reference specific content
- Build relationship before asking

## Hashtag Strategy

- 3-5 hashtags per post
- Mix of sizes:
  - 1-2 large (100K+ followers)
  - 2-3 medium (10K-100K followers)
  - 1 niche (under 10K followers)
- Place at end of post, not in body
- Check hashtag feed quality before using

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Good | Great | Viral |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Impressions | 2x followers | 5x followers | 10x+ followers |
| Engagement Rate | 2% | 5% | 10%+ |
| Comments | 10+ | 50+ | 200+ |
| Profile Views | +10% | +25% | +50% |

## Common LinkedIn Mistakes

- **Thought leader cosplay**: Using template formats without substance
- **All take, no give**: Only posting without engaging with others
- **Generic advice**: "Work hard and be nice" adds nothing
- **Pitch-slapping**: DMs that jump straight to selling
- **Hashtag stuffing**: More than 5 looks desperate
- **Reposting without adding**: Share > Repost, always add perspective
- **Ignoring comments**: Your best engagement opportunity

## LinkedIn-Specific CTAs

- "Drop a 🔥 if this resonates"
- "What would you add to this list?"
- "Share your experience in the comments"
- "Save this for your next [situation]"
- "Follow for more [topic] insights"
- "Tag someone who needs to hear this"
- "Agree or disagree?"
